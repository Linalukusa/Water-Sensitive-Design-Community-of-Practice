                   <h2>WATER SENSITIVE DESIGN IN SA 
                   </h2>
                   
                   <p class="excert">
                   South Africa is a rapidly urbanising country facing complex water management challenges, including: 
                   significant resource shortages, fragmented institutional structures, the increasing burden of wastewaters generated by both 
                   the urbanising population and the growing footprint of the resource-based industrial sector, and the associated negative impacts on the quality of surface and groundwater resources. Alternative approaches to conventional water management which aim to facilitate a change from ‘water-wasteful’ to ‘water-sensitive’ environments will be required if serious economic and socio-political threats are to be averted. Water Sensitive Design, WSD is such an approach, integrating total water cycle management 
                   with the built environment through planning and urban design, providing multiple benefits and opportunities to overcome challenges with water management.

                      The concept of WSD is increasingly being adopted in SA, in 2014,
                      the South African framework and guidelines for WSUD was published (Armitage et al., 2014) as a result of a project funded by the Water Research Commission (WRC). This was followed by the WRC’s development of a WSUD Community of Practice in 2014 and the establishment of WSUD as one of the WRC’s five research focus areas (‘lighthouses’) 
                      in 2015 – with several other WSD-related research projects being initiated.

                   There has been increasing acknowledgement and uptake of the WSD concept at metropolitan city scale, and a significant upswing in the implementation of green infrastructure in private developments throughout the country. The City of Cape Town has committed to becoming a WSC by 2040 as part of its new Water Strategy released in 2020 (City of Cape Town, 2020). Additionally, recent research into the use of SuDS in Gauteng Province has resulted in an Implementation manual and Best Management Practices (see <a href="http://www.futurewater.uct.ac.za/gauteng-suds-research"></a>)
